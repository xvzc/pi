# todo

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

Give the model a task list you can see. `todo` adds a `todo` tool, a
`/todos` command, and a live panel above the editor to
[Pi Agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), so you always know what the
agent is doing now, what it finished, and what is queued. The list is rebuilt
from the conversation itself, so it survives `/reload` and compaction — useful
on long research → design → implement sessions.

## Install

This local extension is loaded from `agent/extensions/pi-todo` via `agent/settings.json`.

Restart your Pi session.

## Quick start

Run `/todos` after the restart to confirm the extension is loaded. On a fresh
session it prints:

```
No todos yet. Ask the agent to add some!
```

Then ask for something with several steps — "add a repository layer with tests,
and track it as todos". The model calls `todo` and the panel appears above your
input box, updating as work moves.

Press `ctrl+shift+t` to collapse the panel to its heading plus a one-line hint,
and again to expand it. Run `/todos` at any time to print the full list grouped
by status.

## What you get

- **The plan stays on screen.** A panel above the editor shows every task with a
  status glyph, the label of whatever is in progress, and a `Todos (done/total)`
  heading — you never have to ask the agent where it is.
- **Tasks survive `/reload` and compaction.** Each tool call carries the full
  post-mutation snapshot, and the list is replayed from the session branch. No
  disk writes, nothing to lose.
- **Finished work gets out of the way.** Completed rows stay visible for the rest
  of the turn, then drop at the start of the next one; the panel disappears
  entirely when the list empties.
- **The overlay never eats your terminal.** Past the row budget it drops
  completed tasks first, truncates unfinished ones last, and tells you what it
  hid with `+3 more (2 completed, 1 pending)`.
- **The agent can sequence work, not just list it.** `blockedBy` dependencies are
  validated before anything is written — dangling ids, deleted dependencies,
  self-blocks, and cycles are all rejected.
- **Parallel sessions stay separate.** Task state is keyed by session, so a
  detached or child session can neither read nor overwrite the foreground list.
- **Fixed English UI.** Overlay labels, statuses, and `/todos` messages are rendered in English.

## Configuration

Optional. Add settings under the top-level `"todo"` key in
`/Users/kazusa/.config/pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "todo": {
    "maxWidgetLines": 8,
    "collapseKey": "alt+t"
  }
}
```

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `maxWidgetLines` | Content rows the overlay may use, heading included. Minimum `3`. Applies on the next repaint. Pi's tool-output expansion mode shows all tasks. | `12` |
| `collapseKey` | Key that collapses and expands the panel, in Pi keybinding form (`alt+o`, `ctrl+shift+t`). Set `"off"` to register no shortcut. Needs `/reload` to rebind. | `"ctrl+shift+t"` |
| `guidance` | Replaces the built-in instructions the extension gives the model about when and how to use the todo list. Needs `/reload`. | _(built-ins)_ |

Missing or malformed settings fall back to these defaults. `todo` only reads
this file — it never writes one. Full semantics:
[Configuration](docs/configuration.md).

## Reference

- [`todo` tool reference](docs/tool-schema.md)
  — every `todo` parameter, the status machine, the response envelope, and the
  exact error strings.
- [Configuration](docs/configuration.md)
  — settings location, option validation rules, and the accepted keybinding
  grammar.
- [Overlay and `/todos`](docs/overlay.md)
  — overlay lifecycle, glyphs, overflow behavior, and `/todos` output.

## Requirements

- A Pi Agent host. No API key, no model selection, no native dependencies.
- An interactive session for the panel and `/todos`. Headless runs still get the
  `todo` tool; nothing is rendered.
